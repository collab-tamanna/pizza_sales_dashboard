The Pizza Sales Dashboard is a comprehensive analytical tool designed to visualize and interpret the sales data of a pizza business. It provides key insights into various metrics such as total sales, revenue trends, popular pizza varieties, and customer preferences. The dashboard includes visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and line graphs to effectively display data across different time periods and locations. By leveraging tools like Microsoft Power BI, this dashboard allows stakeholders to make data-driven decisions, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project showcases my ability to collect, clean, and analyze data, while also demonstrating proficiency in data visualization and reporting.
